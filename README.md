# Reclist

Package reclist reads
and writes records in a simple list format.

The relist format is a human readable,
utf-8 encoded text-file,
with data records.

## Format

In reclist format each record has a type and ID,
the record type is indicated by a string starting
with the at sign (@) and separated from the ID
with an equal sign (=).
Records are composed by key value pairs,
each pair on a single line,
with the key separated from its value
by the colon sign (:).
Type
and keys
are case insensitive,
and without spaces.
Blank lines
and lines starting with the sharp sign (#)
will be ignored.
Multiple line values
should be enclosed by quotation marks (â€œ),
if in the multi-line value
a quotation is used,
it can be escaped using the slash (\\)
before the quotation mark.
Leading spaces will be ignored.

## Example

An example of a reclist is:

```
# Solar system objects
@star=Sun
	radius:	109.3
	mass:	333000
	gravity: 27.94
	descrip: "The Sun is the star at the center
		of the Solar System. It is a nearly
		perfect sphere of hot plasma. It is
		by far the most important source of
		energy for life on Earth."

@planet=Jupiter
	radius:	10.97
	mass:	317.83
	gravity: 2.528
	descrip: "Jupiter is the fifth planet from
		the Sun and the largest in the Solar
		System. It is a giant planet with a
		mass one-thousandth of the Sun, but
		two-and-a-half times that of all other
		planets in the Solar System combined."
	moons:	Ganymede Callisto Io Europa

@planet=Mars
	radius: 0.5320
	mass:	0.107
	gravity: 0.38
	descrip: "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun
		and the second-smallest planet in the
		Solar System after Mercury. Mars is often
		referred as the \"Red Planet\" because
		the iron oxide prevalent on its	surface
		gives it a reddish appearance that is
		disctintive among the astronomical bodies
		visible to the naked eye."

@moon=Titan
	radius:	0.4043
	mass:	0.0225
	gravity: 0.14
	parent: Saturn

@dwarf=Eris
	radius:	0.1825
	mass:	0.0028
	gravity: 0.0672
	family:	SDO
```

Note that indentation
and blank lines are optional
and used for reading ease.

## Source

This format is inspired from
the [record-jar format](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch05s02.html#id2906931)
described by
E. Raymond in *The Art of Unix Programming* (2003) Addison-Wesley,
by the [list format](http://www.strozzi.it/cgi-bin/CSA/tw7/I/en_US/NoSQL/Table%20structure)
of several flat text database systems
such as C. Strozzi NoSQL (2007),
and the [BibTeX bibliography format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX)
of O. Patashnik and L. Lamport (1985).
